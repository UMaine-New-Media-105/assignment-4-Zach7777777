Q1 description: Made a large kahki backround the size of a computer wallpaper and added 4 javascript objects that all use loops to be drawn 

Q2 description: Made the pattern reapeat 5 times for a total of 25 tiles using nested loops, I think 
it looks seemless enough and the pattern kind of reminds me of a quilt 

Q3 Description: Added some randomness to the desnign, i couldn't seem to figure out how to make the colors random 

Q4 Description: Decided to start from scratch with this one as I was starting to hate my other design, I went for the opposite color pallet as well. 
I started this by making 5 seprate 100x100 line tiles that could fill a 100x100 square and connect, next I used if else statments like in the video to 
select each tile from the lines array in the for loops. I had to make 2 seperate for loops to draw the squares and lines respectivly and I think the 10x10 pattern
looks cool with the colors and heavy stroke seleceted.
